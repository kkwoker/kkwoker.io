Haskell is a purely functional programming language. You can't say
you've learned functional programming until you have learned a purely
functional language. There are no concepts of for loops or while loops.
You must use recursion! There are no variables! Only arguments to
functions!

Here's some of the exercises I completed in Haskell.

My final Haskell assignment was to build a rainbow table password
decoder. Check it out
[here](https://github.com/kkwoker/cs-summer2018/tree/master/CMPT383/assign1).

For a comprehensive introduction to Haskell, I recommend the e-book
[Learn you Haskell for Great
Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters).
