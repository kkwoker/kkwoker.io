This little guy is 6 months old and rescued from the Californian
Wildfires. His full name is Alabaster, but I named him Baxter for short.
Baxter loves cuddling and playing with his rainbow sparkler stick.
In his free time, Baxter likes to take naps, jump on tables, and plays
with his scratching post.

I am super excited to have him join our family!
