My simple website built on React is finally up!

I haven't been this proud of my own creation since... well since a very long time.
Work and school had been keeping me busy, so I never had the time to
work on my own projects. This past week however, I decided to take some time off
and finally tackle those things I've been meaning to do. Also, I have exams this week, so
the extra time to study wouldn't hurt!
