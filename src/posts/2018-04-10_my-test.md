After months of flip flopping between static site themes, I've finally
found my solution: Build my own website! This gives me complete rein
over all pixels, structure, and themes. Building my own site also gives
me a place to deploy random application ideas. Something I'm hoping to
get built is some sort of Machine Learning demonstration with
recommending items based on a group of selected items. Stay tuned to see
if I commit to this!

Hurray!
