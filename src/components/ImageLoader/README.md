# ImageLoader


- Takes in a styled-component to include responsive css.
- Implements a fade-in feature (could be extracted out to modularize)
- Implements a placeholder for spacing before images are loaded.
- Loads images as soon as they're downloaded.


### Quirks

- styled-component needs to have height attribute for placeholder to
  render properly.
