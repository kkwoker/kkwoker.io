Words. Words do not equal ideas. <br/>
Ideas are spawn of the imagination, <br/>
most of the time, ideas aren’t dictated. <br/>
You don’t match the words with the ideas. <br/>
They’re points in time. They’re fluctuations. <br/>
They’re instances of a brief capture of a whole concept. <br/>
Hard to write down. <br/>
Hard to put on paper. <br/>
But we try our best.
