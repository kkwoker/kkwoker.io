Capitalism. It’s all around us. <br/>
It’s most prominent in big cities.<br/>
It controls our well being.<br/>
It capitalizes on every aspect of one's life.<br/>
Someone out there is profiting from every action you take.<br/>
You make a meal, the food industry takes a cut.<br/>
You type on a computer, the technology companies take a cut.<br/>
You use the bathroom, the water and toiletry companies take a cut.<br/>
You get paid by your job, the government takes a cut.<br/>
You lift your arm, the health practitioners take a cut.<br/>
Everything is connected.<br/>
It’s a web of trade.<br/>
It runs our lives.<br/>
We are continuously enslaved by it.<br/>
Who deserves these cuts?<br/>
Which companies deserve our consumerism?<br/>
We decide.
