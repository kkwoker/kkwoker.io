I've been working as a software developer of about 5 years now, but
since my current start-up's latest pivot, I became more useful working
with data scientists on research and model building. Although I had some
experience machine learning and deep learning in my undergraduate studies
on machine learning and deep learning, I was no where near the caliber
of scientific knowledge as the phDs I was helping. However, by a month
and a half in, I am figuring out what it means to be a data scientist.

What I found different from product development and scientific research
is a few of the learnings I found.
