I've been working as a software developer of about 5 years now, but
since my current start-up's latest pivot, I became more useful working
with data scientists on research and model building. Although I had some
experience machine learning and deep learning in my undergraduate studies
on machine learning and deep learning, I was no where near the caliber
of scientific knowledge as the phDs I was helping. However, by a month
and a half in, I am figuring out what it means to be a data scientist.

What I found different from product development and scientific research
is a few of the learnings I found.

- Reproducing research is difficult.
 Papers can contain mistakes.

 Lots more reading than as a product developer.

 Product developer reads more about version changes, new features, and
 backwards incompatible changes.

 Data science developer reads more papers. Tries to parse out
 information from papers to see if they're useful.



when someone says their model score is such
well what are you reporting on?

There's a lot of fluff out there

Even labeling is untrusted

ground truth for us may not be the ground truth for the real world

bias is at every layer

documentation is really important
how did past me get here?
 - Good for both product developers and data science developers


open ended research
- too many things to look at!


data science is one sequential process of data gathering, understanding
the data, preprocessing the data, modelling, and then results.

product developers go through iterations of requirements gathering,
software design, development and testing. All with small reversible
cycles in between.

Things are less reversible, and less smaller cycles in data science.
