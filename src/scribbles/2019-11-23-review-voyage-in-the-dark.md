This 1943 novel by Jean Rhys is an interesting one. It mainly uses the
stream of consciousness mode to deliver the thoughts and dream-like
ideas of the main character, Anna Morgan. The novel draws cultural,
racial, feminist ideas as well. The main novel that Rhys is most famous
for, and the best example of a stream of consciousness is probably "The
Wild Sargasso Sea", but I haven't read that one yet.

> “A curtain fell and then I was here."

This very important line says a lot. Anna is living in London, but feels
and remembers her distant self living back in her original home in the
West Indies. The curtains falling symbolizes her play-like being, in
this new city where all is a stage that she was suddenly put on.
Throughout the novel, she frequently describes London as grey and
frowning, while her visions of the past West Indie life was colorful and
joyous.

> Reading this made me think of the similar state I felt when I first
> moved from Vancouver to Toronto. The buildings are much higher here, you
> can't see off into the mountains, nor into the distant ocean. It felt
> like I was trapped, in a video game where the parts I couldn't see were
> just not rendered yet. The mass amounts of people all full of determination,
> with places to be and a sense of self-centered importantance, all felt
> very alienated to me.

And then there's the racial part of the novel. Anna's step mother is
seen quite racist when she says that the servant, Francine, as lesser.
She tries to teach Anna British feminin ideas, but to her loss, Anna
rejects it. Anna’s internalization of her race is complicated by her
appearance as physically white, but her desires to be black. This desire
came from her upbringing in the West Indies where she grew up with the
black community and felt they were more expressive and free than the British
ideals that she was meant to be. “Being black is warm and gay, being white
is cold and sad”, she says.

When putting on a feminism lens, you can see some of the ideas of "The New Woman"
that is an immerging trend in this Modernist era of writing. In the novel, women
are frequently referred to as ‘tart’, which means a provocatively or
promiscuously dressed female. A ‘tart’ is a softer version of ‘whore’,
‘skank’, or ‘slut’ and implies that the woman engages in frequent detrimental
sexual encounters. This dialect boxes women in as degraded prostitutes without
the same sexual freedom rights that men enjoy.  Anna Morgan is so immersed
in this society and believes women have no other choice when she says “why
shouldn’t she be a tart, it’s just as good as anything else, as far as I can see”.

Even at the beginning of the novel, Anna is reading a book about a woman who
uses her sexuality against men in order to obtain wealth and status. This
perhaps is one of the contributing factors for why Anna goes down the path
of sexually exploiting herself in dalliances with random men in hopes of
getting better fortunes.

Eventually, Anna becomes pregnant and goes through an illegal abortion.
She goes through a final stream of consciousness saying that she will repeat
all of unbelonging again. She begins to swirl
into a darkness where she almost kills herself. In the original version
of the story, she does kill herself, but it was later revised so that
she can truely suffer and not be released from it.

I think the moral of the story is to say that, in Anna's situation of
oppressed feminism, of unsure self-identification, she is bound to fall
into suicidal darkness in a society where she doesn't belong.
