Shape. I am shaped by the society I am in. <br/>
I don’t have myself. The world is living me. <br/>
Who am I? I don’t know. Let society decide. <br/>
Let the world leaders decide. <br/>
Let politics decide. <br/>
Let foreign governments decide. <br/>
I am just here. <br/>
Brought here. <br/>
Undecidely. <br/>
Almost, suddenly. <br/>
We are all brought here. <br/>
Undecidely. <br/>
Almost, suddenly. <br/>
But we all have different environments, <br/>
albeit, one Earth, one universe. <br/>
So many different permutations. <br/>
Combinations that run through this world and build up individuals. <br/>
Shape our lives. <br/>
Shape us to become world leaders, poets, business people. <br/>
Shape us to become starved, homeless, controlled. Helpless. <br/>
Work hard? No. <br/>
We’re stuck. <br/>
Stuck in our social status. <br/>
We are all stuck.
